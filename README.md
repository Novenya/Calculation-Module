# Calculation-Module
 C#.NET program for calculating the final mark of a student for a Programming module
 
This final mark is calculated by using the marks of different assessments and their particular weights:

Assessment                           Weight

Test 1                                15%
Test 2                                20%
The best mark of 2 class tests        15%
Final Examination                     50%

When you clicked the Final Mark Button, it should calculate the final mark and to determine
whether it is a pass or fail (message). The student will pass the exam, if his final mark is
greater than or equal to 50.
